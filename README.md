## Business/Domain Understanding

Financial markets are fundamental institutions in any developing economy. They play a crucial role in promoting economic growth by facilitating the channeling of
saving decisions into productive investment. A major concern for financial institutions is credit risk, because if not managed properly, it can lead to a banking collapse.
In our banking system, banks have many products to sell but the main source of income of any bank is on its credit line. Loan is the core business part of banks.
A bank's profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e. whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting.
Though a lot of people are applying for loans. However, they may have some difficulty in repaying the loan, due to their own capability to repay loan, their
personal monetary terms, etc.. It’s hard to select the genuine applicant, who will repay the loan. While doing the process manually, a lot of misconception may
happen to select the genuine applicant. The banks hold the risk of losing the amount loaned to the borrowers, which is basically regarded as "Credit risk".
Credit risk is the potential that a bank’s borrower or counterparty fails to meet its obligations in repaying the loan borrowed from the financial institutions ("banks").
By predicting the loan defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non-Performing Assets. This makes the study of this phenomenon very important.
Thus, the banks need to manage the credit risks in their portfolio both at the individual borrower and transactional level, as well as to consider the linkage
between credit risks and other types of risk. This is because these are criteria to assess the success/failure of any banking lending activities.
Many research confirmed that machine learning technology is highly efficient to predict this situation. This technique is applied through learning from previous data.

### What is Credit Risk?

Credit risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their obligations
in repaying a debt. In other words, it's the risk that a borrower might default on a
loan or be unable to meet their contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss
for the lender.

Managing and assessing credit risk is a crucial aspect of financial management
for both lenders and borrowers. Lenders employ various tools and models, like
credit scoring systems, to evaluate and mitigate credit risk. Borrowers, on the
other hand, seek to maintain good creditworthiness to secure favorable lending
terms and opportunities.
